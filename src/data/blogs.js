    content: `What's Zia.. 

Zoho's AI 
or
An Indian LLM
or 
It's a competitor for ChatGPT. 

Before answering all these questions.. 

Way back when I was in my first year of college, Sridhar Vembu (Chief Scientist - Zoho) came to the college for an award ceremony.. I didn't remember anything about the ceremony except those words from his mouth.. Yes, he said - "In Zoho, we are trying to find new domains to work with.. Searching for something to go after Saas apps."

Just a minute.. You may think I am going to tell you it was Zia.. The one Zoho tried to identify over the years.. It's not.. 

But to know what Zoho identified, we need to know "What is Zia? "And how Zia helped Zoho to identify its new path?"

In a race, where every company tries to implement another company's AI model into their application for their user satisfaction.. Zoho thought it differently - For instance, on Zoho's YouTube page they say - A cloud company not owning their cloud is like a car company not doing their own engine. So you don't become a tech company in that sense, where you become the reseller of someone else's technology.. But what's the result? 

Trained on 7 billion parameters - Zia is the first LLM built explicitly for B2B. And now we can proudly say that India is not just using AI, we're becoming the producers of it! 

And it's a massive 20 million dollar AI infrastructure.. With 25+ prebuilt models and 3 LLMs. Zia is implanted in almost all of Zoho's applications (55+ apps) 

In Zoho CRM, 
1. Users can interact with Zia using natural language to ask questions, make requests, and receive instant responses.
2. Zia can fetch customer information, sales forecasts, and other relevant data.
3. Task Management: Zia can set reminders, create tasks, meetings, or calls based on user requests.

Let's come to the point where I started this.. What's that new path? 

It's VERTICAL SAAS - Even the CEO of Zoho, Mani Vembu, says that, "The company identifies this as a major growth area similar to where horizontal SaaS was two decades ago."

Vertical SaaS and Horizontal SaaS are two distinct models in the Software as a Service (SaaS) industry, often differentiated by their target audience. 
- Vertical SaaS focuses on serving the specific needs of a single industry, like healthcare, etc, with tailored solutions.
- Horizontal SaaS offers solutions applicable to various industries by addressing common business functions like CRM, project management, etc.. 

In short, vertical SaaS is specialized, while horizontal SaaS is generalized. And for providing those specialized things, Zia comes into the picture. 

In my POV, Kudos to Zoho, who took the hardest way by training their models for their customer privacy and scalability. And finally, we gotta Homegrown AI!

Thanks for reading till the end!

    content: `Did Blinkit.. 

A big yess! 

So-called Quick Commerce Company - Blinkit showed that, "Quick is not about delivering groceries.. But also saving lives as well. "

Recently, Blinkit has launched its 10-minute ambulance service.. Wait a minute - it was rolled out back in January 2025. Though it launched earlier, what brings me to write this now is that word that one single word, 10 minutes. 

Excited by this, I did a little digging.. And I stumbled upon something even more interesting. 

Think of this peopleü§î, How can someone say that they will be able to provide emergency healthcare service via an ambulance that you booked 10 minutes ago in an app? (Funny thing is, Blinkit does this within 10 minutes)

Just like groceries, right? But astonishingly, Blinkit has accomplished this, and honestly, it‚Äôs impressive how they pulled it off.

Initially started with 5 ambulances in Gurugram. Now they have expanded to 12 ambulances. Reportedly, they have responded to 594 calls, 50% of which are critical emergencies.

To get to the point, Dhindsa (CEO Blinkit) said that, 

1. The ambulances would have medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders, AEDs (Automated External Defibrillator), stretchers, monitors, suction machines, emergency medicines, and injections. 

2. The ambulance will come with a paramedic, an assistant, and a trained driver.

He also added, 

Profit is not a goal here. We will operate this service at an affordable cost for customers and invest in really solving this critical problem for the long term. 

We are carefully scaling this service up, as it is both important and new to us. We aim to expand to all major cities over the next two years.

In my POV, we've all heard this heartbreaking line in movies and real life:
"If you had brought the patient 10 minutes before, he would have been alive now."
That‚Äôs the golden hour. Blinkit is aiming to change that narrative.

Even though many people criticise that this service should be provided by the Government at free of cost and with standards. It's tough in a densely populated country like ours.

Those who used this service are applauding on social media about their pre-hospital care, etc.. 

And according to me, this initiative is a game changer in the emergency healthcare industry and a life changer for many!

Thanks for reading till the end!

    content: `Personal thought ‚Äì This story will not adapt with you, if you‚Äôre a FIRST BENCHER.

So My dear friends‚Ä¶ this story revolves around a 4 x 4 room. Literally three freshers (including me) of TCE waiting for their fourth room-mate. And the fourth one is not arrived for some weeks.

In that meantime, let me explain you about my rest of the two homies‚Ä¶

First one who had low marks‚Ä¶joined this college‚Ä¶thinking that it‚Äôs because of God‚Äôs Grace.

Next one is me‚Ä¶who had none other option than TCE. But the third one is interesting (Actually he is our hero) who joined here with more marks than the required‚Ä¶But the dot is he will study more than 6 hrs a day‚Ä¶at a stretch.

On seeing his study methods, me and God‚Äôs Grace roommie.. started giggling him and as an extension of this, We started to talk gossips about him to the next doors.. However he kept quiet ..not scolding but literally not even thinking bad about us.

And another mention is, he is an Early-bird.. waking up at 4:30am and bathing at 6‚Ä¶ That was really an impossible event for me.

After three weeks, the fourth roomie arrived‚Ä¶ and I talked him‚Ä¶ literally flattered about the Early-bird.

Me to Fourth roomie: somebody will tell you that you need to go to the bathroom on or before 6.. so that it will be free‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs not like that you can even go at 8‚Äô o clock like me.
And it‚Äôs the first and last time‚Ä¶ that our Early-bird got angry at me, knowing that I was doing sarcasm on him.
Mentally, showing his anger by throwing his Coconut oil bottle near me‚Ä¶
Don‚Äôt think that I am a very bad guy‚Ä¶ Actually I am a good guy‚Ä¶ May be you can even consider me as the second hero the story.

Then there existed a Tug of War between us for some weeks‚Ä¶ but it stopped at the Internal exams.He helped me to cope with the syllabus‚Ä¶ and even I too got only some less marks than him‚Ä¶ But actually he was more happier for me getting good marks‚Ä¶ And we started becoming ‚ÄúGood fighting friends‚Äù.

Days gone with those pleasant room-mates‚Ä¶ teasing each other and most of the time talking about the boy besties & girl besties in the FC.

Sometimes my favourite room-mate (Early Bird) can even be better than an alarm‚Ä¶ He won‚Äôt leave me till I woke up.

With the help of him.. I crossed my first year with good CGPA.. tackling CALCULAS and EDS papers. And also he was recently awarded in a CSE event for getting overall high CGPA‚Ä¶ actually I missed it becoz I literally bunked it.
And atlast and atleast we need someguy like him to make our lives better and more lighter‚Ä¶ Coz these types of friends won‚Äôt leave us do wrong things.

But guys like me need these type of first bench friends for their assignment goods too‚Ä¶
Moreover it may feel like a small wagon of FIVE POINT SOMEONE of Chetan Bhagat‚Ä¶But this is MY STORY ‚Äì so it must be a ‚ÄúCULT CLASSIC‚Äù.
