    content: `What's Zia.. 

Zoho's AI 
or
An Indian LLM
or 
It's a competitor for ChatGPT. 

Before answering all these questions.. 

Way back when I was in my first year of college, Sridhar Vembu (Chief Scientist - Zoho) came to the college for an award ceremony.. I didn't remember anything about the ceremony except those words from his mouth.. Yes, he said - "In Zoho, we are trying to find new domains to work with.. Searching for something to go after Saas apps."

Just a minute.. You may think I am going to tell you it was Zia.. The one Zoho tried to identify over the years.. It's not.. 

But to know what Zoho identified, we need to know "What is Zia? "And how Zia helped Zoho to identify its new path?"

In a race, where every company tries to implement another company's AI model into their application for their user satisfaction.. Zoho thought it differently - For instance, on Zoho's YouTube page they say - A cloud company not owning their cloud is like a car company not doing their own engine. So you don't become a tech company in that sense, where you become the reseller of someone else's technology.. But what's the result? 

Trained on 7 billion parameters - Zia is the first LLM built explicitly for B2B. And now we can proudly say that India is not just using AI, we're becoming the producers of it! 

And it's a massive 20 million dollar AI infrastructure.. With 25+ prebuilt models and 3 LLMs. Zia is implanted in almost all of Zoho's applications (55+ apps) 

In Zoho CRM, 
1. Users can interact with Zia using natural language to ask questions, make requests, and receive instant responses.
2. Zia can fetch customer information, sales forecasts, and other relevant data.
3. Task Management: Zia can set reminders, create tasks, meetings, or calls based on user requests.

Let's come to the point where I started this.. What's that new path? 

It's VERTICAL SAAS - Even the CEO of Zoho, Mani Vembu, says that, "The company identifies this as a major growth area similar to where horizontal SaaS was two decades ago."

Vertical SaaS and Horizontal SaaS are two distinct models in the Software as a Service (SaaS) industry, often differentiated by their target audience. 
- Vertical SaaS focuses on serving the specific needs of a single industry, like healthcare, etc, with tailored solutions.
- Horizontal SaaS offers solutions applicable to various industries by addressing common business functions like CRM, project management, etc.. 

In short, vertical SaaS is specialized, while horizontal SaaS is generalized. And for providing those specialized things, Zia comes into the picture. 

In my POV, Kudos to Zoho, who took the hardest way by training their models for their customer privacy and scalability. And finally, we gotta Homegrown AI!

Thanks for reading till the end!

    content: `Did Blinkit.. 

A big yess! 

So-called Quick Commerce Company - Blinkit showed that, "Quick is not about delivering groceries.. But also saving lives as well. "

Recently, Blinkit has launched its 10-minute ambulance service.. Wait a minute - it was rolled out back in January 2025. Though it launched earlier, what brings me to write this now is that word that one single word, 10 minutes. 

Excited by this, I did a little digging.. And I stumbled upon something even more interesting. 

Think of this peopleü§î, How can someone say that they will be able to provide emergency healthcare service via an ambulance that you booked 10 minutes ago in an app? (Funny thing is, Blinkit does this within 10 minutes)

Just like groceries, right? But astonishingly, Blinkit has accomplished this, and honestly, it‚Äôs impressive how they pulled it off.

Initially started with 5 ambulances in Gurugram. Now they have expanded to 12 ambulances. Reportedly, they have responded to 594 calls, 50% of which are critical emergencies.

To get to the point, Dhindsa (CEO Blinkit) said that, 

1. The ambulances would have medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders, AEDs (Automated External Defibrillator), stretchers, monitors, suction machines, emergency medicines, and injections. 

2. The ambulance will come with a paramedic, an assistant, and a trained driver.

He also added, 

Profit is not a goal here. We will operate this service at an affordable cost for customers and invest in really solving this critical problem for the long term. 

We are carefully scaling this service up, as it is both important and new to us. We aim to expand to all major cities over the next two years.

In my POV, we've all heard this heartbreaking line in movies and real life:
"If you had brought the patient 10 minutes before, he would have been alive now."
That‚Äôs the golden hour. Blinkit is aiming to change that narrative.

Even though many people criticise that this service should be provided by the Government at free of cost and with standards. It's tough in a densely populated country like ours.

Those who used this service are applauding on social media about their pre-hospital care, etc.. 

And according to me, this initiative is a game changer in the emergency healthcare industry and a life changer for many!

Thanks for reading till the end!

    content: `Personal thought ‚Äì This story will not adapt with you, if you‚Äôre a FIRST BENCHER.

So My dear friends‚Ä¶ this story revolves around a 4 x 4 room. Literally three freshers (including me) of TCE waiting for their fourth room-mate. And the fourth one is not arrived for some weeks.

In that meantime, let me explain you about my rest of the two homies‚Ä¶

First one who had low marks‚Ä¶joined this college‚Ä¶thinking that it‚Äôs because of God‚Äôs Grace.

Next one is me‚Ä¶who had none other option than TCE. But the third one is interesting (Actually he is our hero) who joined here with more marks than the required‚Ä¶But the dot is he will study more than 6 hrs a day‚Ä¶at a stretch.

On seeing his study methods, me and God‚Äôs Grace roommie.. started giggling him and as an extension of this, We started to talk gossips about him to the next doors.. However he kept quiet ..not scolding but literally not even thinking bad about us.

And another mention is, he is an Early-bird.. waking up at 4:30am and bathing at 6‚Ä¶ That was really an impossible event for me.

After three weeks, the fourth roomie arrived‚Ä¶ and I talked him‚Ä¶ literally flattered about the Early-bird.

Me to Fourth roomie: somebody will tell you that you need to go to the bathroom on or before 6.. so that it will be free‚Ä¶but it‚Äôs not like that you can even go at 8‚Äô o clock like me.
And it‚Äôs the first and last time‚Ä¶ that our Early-bird got angry at me, knowing that I was doing sarcasm on him.
Mentally, showing his anger by throwing his Coconut oil bottle near me‚Ä¶
Don‚Äôt think that I am a very bad guy‚Ä¶ Actually I am a good guy‚Ä¶ May be you can even consider me as the second hero the story.

Then there existed a Tug of War between us for some weeks‚Ä¶ but it stopped at the Internal exams.He helped me to cope with the syllabus‚Ä¶ and even I too got only some less marks than him‚Ä¶ But actually he was more happier for me getting good marks‚Ä¶ And we started becoming ‚ÄúGood fighting friends‚Äù.

Days gone with those pleasant room-mates‚Ä¶ teasing each other and most of the time talking about the boy besties & girl besties in the FC.

Sometimes my favourite room-mate (Early Bird) can even be better than an alarm‚Ä¶ He won‚Äôt leave me till I woke up.

With the help of him.. I crossed my first year with good CGPA.. tackling CALCULAS and EDS papers. And also he was recently awarded in a CSE event for getting overall high CGPA‚Ä¶ actually I missed it becoz I literally bunked it.
And atlast and atleast we need someguy like him to make our lives better and more lighter‚Ä¶ Coz these types of friends won‚Äôt leave us do wrong things.

But guys like me need these type of first bench friends for their assignment goods too‚Ä¶
Moreover it may feel like a small wagon of FIVE POINT SOMEONE of Chetan Bhagat‚Ä¶But this is MY STORY ‚Äì so it must be a ‚ÄúCULT CLASSIC‚Äù.

    title: "What happened when Google was a startup? How Dutch auction IPO helped Google when it was a startup?",
    genre: 'startup-stories',
    summary: 'A detailed breakdown of IPO, Dutch vs English auction',

    content:`Welcome to the world of Lannisters and Starks.. Wait, wait, wait.. You might think, if you are going to talk about Game of Thrones, then why is the title 
How Dutch auction help Google win its IPO?
Or 
How Dutch auction differ from an English auction? 

You might get strange.. What is IPO? What is a Dutch auction? What is an English auction? Or Even What this guy is blabbering about?

But believe me, fellas, everything converges in this story of Game of Thrones.. In our Westeros (World Market), there were two kingdoms. One is the Lannisters (where the rich get richer), and another is the Starks (who believe they and their kingdom are because of the people) 

Yesterday night, I think around 3 am (Don't misunderstand me as a cyber zombie), while surfing the internet, I found 2 stories

Story 1 - Journey through turbulence:

In early 2020, Airbnb was riding high. The company had revolutionized the travel industry by allowing homeowners to rent out their properties. Hopes were high for their IPO.

An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process by which a privately owned company offers shares of its stock to the public for the first time. It can be understood as a company's debut on the stock market. Before an IPO, a company is typically funded by a smaller group of investors, such as its founders, VCs, etc. Going public allows a company to raise significant capital from a much wider pool of investors to fund its growth. 

While Airbnb prepared for its IPO Coronation ceremony, disaster struck. The COVID-19 pandemic brought global travel to a screeching halt. Within weeks, Airbnb's bookings plummeted by over 80%. The company was reportedly losing money, found itself in a fight for survival. An IPO seemed impossible. But their resilience and emergency funding at higher interest rates took them to post-COVID. 

However, what happened next was a testament to the company's adaptability. As lockdowns eased, a new travel trend emerged: people looked for longer-term stays in domestic locations, often in rural areas, to escape crowded cities and work remotely. Airbnb's business model with its diversity perfectly suited to this shift.

In Dec 2020, the Coronation ceremony happened again. Airbnb went public. The initial IPO price was set at $68 per share and went till $146, more than double its initial price. Finally, Airbnb was valued at over $100 billion. 

Motivating, right? But there was always someone who would say, "In the school where you studied, I was the headmaster. "

Yeah, there begins our real story. 

Story 2: Lannisters vs Starks

The cyber zombie inside me never slept yesterday till 5 am.. And I read another article that came to me randomly. 

Imagine yourself in a kingdom that started to flourish recently (Google's startup stage), the Stark King(Larry Page) tried to expand his Kingdom, tried to find investments for his troops(Google going for public IPOs). He went to the wealthiest Kingdom of Lannisters for investment and to get higher returns. But there, the tradition was to separate the investment and give it to the wealthiest landlords and allies for a high return. The common folk, the very people who helped and loved the Kingdom every day, would be locked outside the castle gates. They are not nourished, not even supported. (That is, by giving shares to big investment firms, normal people can't buy the shares.) The Stark King reflected on this and left with a word, "Our strength comes from the people. They should be the first to share in our future, not the last." Stark King said he would make everyone a part of his future, the Lannisters said it's impossible, and the Kingdom would fall. But the Stark King used a magical spell called the Democratic spell! 

Coming to real time, with its search engine, Google was beloved by the people of the digital realm. But for development after their initial success, Google knew it needed more resources. So the founders thought of going for the IPO. 

Traditionally, during an IPO, big investment banks call the shots. They decide who gets to buy the initial shares and at what price. This system often favours big, wealthy clients, leaving the average person out.

‚ÄãGoogle‚Äôs founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, thought this was unfair. They wanted everyone, from their own users to small-time investors, to have a fair chance at buying their shares. Their motto was "Don't Be Evil," and they wanted their IPO to reflect that.

‚ÄãSo, they chose a very unusual method, the magical spell I mentioned, which is called DUTCH AUCTION.

What is a Dutch Auction IPO?

‚ÄãInstead of letting the banks set a fixed price

‚ÄãBidding: The company announces a potential price range. Any investor (big or small) can bid on how many shares they want and the maximum price they are willing to pay.

‚ÄãFinding the Price: The company then looks at all the bids, starting from the highest price and going down, until it finds a price where all the shares it wants to sell can be sold. This price is called the "Clearing price".

‚ÄãDemocratic pay: Here's the revolutionary part. Everyone who bid at or above the clearing price gets the shares, and they all pay the same price, the clearing price. It doesn't matter if you bid $100 and the final price was $85; you only pay $85.

August 19, 2004 - After all the criticism, Google went ahead and set their clearing price, i.e., the final IPO price at $85 per share. The company was valued at about $23 billion on its first day.

Global behemoth Transformation of Google:

The $85 per share was just the beginning. Google used the funds from the IPO to dominate
1. Search engine market
2. Develop Android
3. Buy YouTube, and invest in countless other technologies. 

‚ÄãThat initial $85 share has since split multiple times. Just an investment of $1,000 back in 2004 would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars today. And the rest is history.. 

The key takeaway I had from the Story of Google's unconventional IPO is.. Give returns to your native, support the people who supported you!

Thanks for reading till the end!

  content:`Sept 27, 2025- An unforgivable and unforgettable day of my life. Not talking about the Stampede at Vijay's political rally in Karur... I deeply mourn for the lost souls.. But this day sept 27 is something personal for me.

I'll tell you why... This day shook away the happiness that held my hidden smile from most of you. Drained the last drop of hope that resided in my heart. 

Some days leave scars so deep that you can‚Äôt forget them. September 27, 2025, is one of those days for me.

My eyes started to sweat.. Nothing rolled down except thoughts. Those thoughts flowed like a river inside my nerves so that I can't even cope up with it's speed. Some thoughts made me feel guilty, some made me angry, others made me mourn; ultimately, they made me feel lost. But this river of thoughts ended up in a sea - the sea of enlightenment, the sea of happiness, where I found a treasure with a magical scroll containing three spells. 

You know, the bad day of my life ended with a good sleep... That's because those spells that gave me the serenity. 

FIRST SPELL: 

From the day my awareness dawn, I was carrying a trauma silently which was an untold one to my childhood buddies, to my understanding friends, even to my parents. It haunted me for 20 years. But this day sept 27, 2025 dwarfed a bigger trauma than the one I was holding throughout my lifetime.

I was floundering that day... Did I actually do something wrong?
Or am I blaming myself for something beyond my control? These thoughts left me feel guilty ultimately.. But the first spell in the scroll gave me the answer - 

"YOU TRIED IT TRULY, BUT IT WENT BADLY... " -  Yea I tried it truly that's for sure but how it ended? It's not in my hands.. Right?

Fix it; if you can‚Äôt, forgive yourself. Grow from it!

Yes... That's the thing I wanted... Because at some point
It's ok to feel guilty... Feeling guilty is just a call from our mind telling us the very thing that we're doing unknowingly was not aligning with our values. 

SECOND SPELL:

I forgave myself but how will I grow from it? 

Over the time, It was my fuel for growing. Now without that essential how my car is gonna run?

I can't compare the pain of my first thought and this... Both are painful... But this thought is not about forgiving it's about forgetting - the very own thing that made me feel happy... This thought gave me the biggest ache.

Surprisingly this thought was stopped when I read the second spell of the scroll... 

Just wanna tell you one thing which I understood from that spell, 
"It doesn't matter how much pain you have endured in past if you get hurt again it pains the same that's for sure. 
Just the threshold goes up.
Keep trusting yourself and start building your own best version."

Yeaa.. The second spell that lifted me up was - "WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER EVENTUALLY."

At that moment of sept 27, after reading that second spell, the boy I once was faded, and a man began to emerge. It wasn‚Äôt about losing innocence; it was about gaining resilience. It's my official wrap to my teen years. 

Just felt like someone is chanting this in my eyes - Kill the boy, and let the man be born John Snow!

THIRD SPELL:

I didn't remember who said this to me... But in my childhood I heard this from someone "The more you laugh in a day, the more tears you‚Äôll shed by the end of the day."

Of course... It's true

"The Person You Love Is the Person You Fight With."

The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over.

Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice. Whatever makes us feel good will inevitably also make us feel bad.

In my case.. It's the september month of 2025. It started as a spring but ended in autumn. Coz This is the month I got my placement offer... This month carried my wish come true moments... But by the end it crucified me.

Yet, in rewinding it, I saw myself celebrating the perks and forgot the peak I needed to climb which was awaiting for me... And in my whole life, I too waited for it... 

At some point in life we may feel guilty, angry with ourselves, thought of losing, disappointment, dissatisfaction with our own self, even the feeling of crucification like me.. But think of this, always there will be an INNER DREAM for everyone of us. Start mastering yourself for it. Conquer it. Because I am damn sure when you reach the top of your peak.. That is your desired destiny you will feel satisfied - the guilt, the anger, the pain everything you're carrying vanishes at that moment... It's because you‚Äôre the one standing there alone, enduring all your pains and crossing all your own hurdles!

And today I am going to start climbing my peak... What are you going to do? Gonna enjoy your perks or...

Want to know the final spell of the scroll - "NEXT STOP, THE TOP!"

Thanks for reading till the end dear friend.
