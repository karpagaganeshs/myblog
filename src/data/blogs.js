    content: `What's Zia.. 

Zoho's AI 
or
An Indian LLM
or 
It's a competitor for ChatGPT. 

Before answering all these questions.. 

Way back when I was in my first year of college, Sridhar Vembu (Chief Scientist - Zoho) came to the college for an award ceremony.. I didn't remember anything about the ceremony except those words from his mouth.. Yes, he said - "In Zoho, we are trying to find new domains to work with.. Searching for something to go after Saas apps."

Just a minute.. You may think I am going to tell you it was Zia.. The one Zoho tried to identify over the years.. It's not.. 

But to know what Zoho identified, we need to know "What is Zia? "And how Zia helped Zoho to identify its new path?"

In a race, where every company tries to implement another company's AI model into their application for their user satisfaction.. Zoho thought it differently - For instance, on Zoho's YouTube page they say - A cloud company not owning their cloud is like a car company not doing their own engine. So you don't become a tech company in that sense, where you become the reseller of someone else's technology.. But what's the result? 

Trained on 7 billion parameters - Zia is the first LLM built explicitly for B2B. And now we can proudly say that India is not just using AI, we're becoming the producers of it! 

And it's a massive 20 million dollar AI infrastructure.. With 25+ prebuilt models and 3 LLMs. Zia is implanted in almost all of Zoho's applications (55+ apps) 

In Zoho CRM, 
1. Users can interact with Zia using natural language to ask questions, make requests, and receive instant responses.
2. Zia can fetch customer information, sales forecasts, and other relevant data.
3. Task Management: Zia can set reminders, create tasks, meetings, or calls based on user requests.

Let's come to the point where I started this.. What's that new path? 

It's VERTICAL SAAS - Even the CEO of Zoho, Mani Vembu, says that, "The company identifies this as a major growth area similar to where horizontal SaaS was two decades ago."

Vertical SaaS and Horizontal SaaS are two distinct models in the Software as a Service (SaaS) industry, often differentiated by their target audience. 
- Vertical SaaS focuses on serving the specific needs of a single industry, like healthcare, etc, with tailored solutions.
- Horizontal SaaS offers solutions applicable to various industries by addressing common business functions like CRM, project management, etc.. 

In short, vertical SaaS is specialized, while horizontal SaaS is generalized. And for providing those specialized things, Zia comes into the picture. 

In my POV, Kudos to Zoho, who took the hardest way by training their models for their customer privacy and scalability. And finally, we gotta Homegrown AI!

    content: `Did Blinkit.. 

A big yess! 

So-called Quick Commerce Company - Blinkit showed that, "Quick is not about delivering groceries.. But also saving lives as well. "

Recently, Blinkit has launched its 10-minute ambulance service.. Wait a minute - it was rolled out back in January 2025. Though it launched earlier, what brings me to write this now is that word that one single word, 10 minutes. 

Excited by this, I did a little digging.. And I stumbled upon something even more interesting. 

Think of this people🤔, How can someone say that they will be able to provide emergency healthcare service via an ambulance that you booked 10 minutes ago in an app? (Funny thing is, Blinkit does this within 10 minutes)

Just like groceries, right? But astonishingly, Blinkit has accomplished this, and honestly, it’s impressive how they pulled it off.

Initially started with 5 ambulances in Gurugram. Now they have expanded to 12 ambulances. Reportedly, they have responded to 594 calls, 50% of which are critical emergencies.

To get to the point, Dhindsa (CEO Blinkit) said that, 

1. The ambulances would have medical equipment such as oxygen cylinders, AEDs (Automated External Defibrillator), stretchers, monitors, suction machines, emergency medicines, and injections. 

2. The ambulance will come with a paramedic, an assistant, and a trained driver.

He also added, 

Profit is not a goal here. We will operate this service at an affordable cost for customers and invest in really solving this critical problem for the long term. 

We are carefully scaling this service up, as it is both important and new to us. We aim to expand to all major cities over the next two years.

In my POV, we've all heard this heartbreaking line in movies and real life:
"If you had brought the patient 10 minutes before, he would have been alive now."
That’s the golden hour. Blinkit is aiming to change that narrative.

Even though many people criticise that this service should be provided by the Government at free of cost and with standards. It's tough in a densely populated country like ours.

Those who used this service are applauding on social media about their pre-hospital care, etc.. 

And according to me, this initiative is a game changer in the emergency healthcare industry and a life changer for many!

    content: `Personal thought – This story will not adapt with you, if you’re a FIRST BENCHER.

So My dear friends… this story revolves around a 4 x 4 room. Literally three freshers (including me) of TCE waiting for their fourth room-mate. And the fourth one is not arrived for some weeks.

In that meantime, let me explain you about my rest of the two homies…

First one who had low marks…joined this college…thinking that it’s because of God’s Grace.

Next one is me…who had none other option than TCE. But the third one is interesting (Actually he is our hero) who joined here with more marks than the required…But the dot is he will study more than 6 hrs a day…at a stretch.

On seeing his study methods, me and God’s Grace roommie.. started giggling him and as an extension of this, We started to talk gossips about him to the next doors.. However he kept quiet ..not scolding but literally not even thinking bad about us.

And another mention is, he is an Early-bird.. waking up at 4:30am and bathing at 6… That was really an impossible event for me.

After three weeks, the fourth roomie arrived… and I talked him… literally flattered about the Early-bird.

Me to Fourth roomie: somebody will tell you that you need to go to the bathroom on or before 6.. so that it will be free…but it’s not like that you can even go at 8’ o clock like me.
And it’s the first and last time… that our Early-bird got angry at me, knowing that I was doing sarcasm on him.
Mentally, showing his anger by throwing his Coconut oil bottle near me…
Don’t think that I am a very bad guy… Actually I am a good guy… May be you can even consider me as the second hero the story.

Then there existed a Tug of War between us for some weeks… but it stopped at the Internal exams.He helped me to cope with the syllabus… and even I too got only some less marks than him… But actually he was more happier for me getting good marks… And we started becoming “Good fighting friends”.

Days gone with those pleasant room-mates… teasing each other and most of the time talking about the boy besties & girl besties in the FC.

Sometimes my favourite room-mate (Early Bird) can even be better than an alarm… He won’t leave me till I woke up.

With the help of him.. I crossed my first year with good CGPA.. tackling CALCULAS and EDS papers. And also he was recently awarded in a CSE event for getting overall high CGPA… actually I missed it becoz I literally bunked it.
And atlast and atleast we need someguy like him to make our lives better and more lighter… Coz these types of friends won’t leave us do wrong things.

But guys like me need these type of first bench friends for their assignment goods too…
Moreover it may feel like a small wagon of FIVE POINT SOMEONE of Chetan Bhagat…But this is MY STORY – so it must be a “CULT CLASSIC”.

    content:`Welcome to the world of Lannisters and Starks.. Wait, wait, wait.. You might think, if you are going to talk about Game of Thrones, then why is the title 
How Dutch auction help Google win its IPO?
Or 
How Dutch auction differ from an English auction? 

You might get strange.. What is IPO? What is a Dutch auction? What is an English auction? Or Even What this guy is blabbering about?

But believe me, fellas, everything converges in this story of Game of Thrones.. In our Westeros (World Market), there were two kingdoms. One is the Lannisters (where the rich get richer), and another is the Starks (who believe they and their kingdom are because of the people) 

Yesterday night, I think around 3 am (Don't misunderstand me as a cyber zombie), while surfing the internet, I found 2 stories

Story 1 - Journey through turbulence:

In early 2020, Airbnb was riding high. The company had revolutionized the travel industry by allowing homeowners to rent out their properties. Hopes were high for their IPO.

An Initial Public Offering (IPO) is the process by which a privately owned company offers shares of its stock to the public for the first time. It can be understood as a company's debut on the stock market. Before an IPO, a company is typically funded by a smaller group of investors, such as its founders, VCs, etc. Going public allows a company to raise significant capital from a much wider pool of investors to fund its growth. 

While Airbnb prepared for its IPO Coronation ceremony, disaster struck. The COVID-19 pandemic brought global travel to a screeching halt. Within weeks, Airbnb's bookings plummeted by over 80%. The company was reportedly losing money, found itself in a fight for survival. An IPO seemed impossible. But their resilience and emergency funding at higher interest rates took them to post-COVID. 

However, what happened next was a testament to the company's adaptability. As lockdowns eased, a new travel trend emerged: people looked for longer-term stays in domestic locations, often in rural areas, to escape crowded cities and work remotely. Airbnb's business model with its diversity perfectly suited to this shift.

In Dec 2020, the Coronation ceremony happened again. Airbnb went public. The initial IPO price was set at $68 per share and went till $146, more than double its initial price. Finally, Airbnb was valued at over $100 billion. 

Motivating, right? But there was always someone who would say, "In the school where you studied, I was the headmaster. "

Yeah, there begins our real story. 

Story 2: Lannisters vs Starks

The cyber zombie inside me never slept yesterday till 5 am.. And I read another article that came to me randomly. 

Imagine yourself in a kingdom that started to flourish recently (Google's startup stage), the Stark King(Larry Page) tried to expand his Kingdom, tried to find investments for his troops(Google going for public IPOs). He went to the wealthiest Kingdom of Lannisters for investment and to get higher returns. But there, the tradition was to separate the investment and give it to the wealthiest landlords and allies for a high return. The common folk, the very people who helped and loved the Kingdom every day, would be locked outside the castle gates. They are not nourished, not even supported. (That is, by giving shares to big investment firms, normal people can't buy the shares.) The Stark King reflected on this and left with a word, "Our strength comes from the people. They should be the first to share in our future, not the last." Stark King said he would make everyone a part of his future, the Lannisters said it's impossible, and the Kingdom would fall. But the Stark King used a magical spell called the Democratic spell! 

Coming to real time, with its search engine, Google was beloved by the people of the digital realm. But for development after their initial success, Google knew it needed more resources. So the founders thought of going for the IPO. 

Traditionally, during an IPO, big investment banks call the shots. They decide who gets to buy the initial shares and at what price. This system often favours big, wealthy clients, leaving the average person out.

​Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, thought this was unfair. They wanted everyone, from their own users to small-time investors, to have a fair chance at buying their shares. Their motto was "Don't Be Evil," and they wanted their IPO to reflect that.

​So, they chose a very unusual method, the magical spell I mentioned, which is called DUTCH AUCTION.

What is a Dutch Auction IPO?

​Instead of letting the banks set a fixed price

​Bidding: The company announces a potential price range. Any investor (big or small) can bid on how many shares they want and the maximum price they are willing to pay.

​Finding the Price: The company then looks at all the bids, starting from the highest price and going down, until it finds a price where all the shares it wants to sell can be sold. This price is called the "Clearing price".

​Democratic pay: Here's the revolutionary part. Everyone who bid at or above the clearing price gets the shares, and they all pay the same price, the clearing price. It doesn't matter if you bid $100 and the final price was $85; you only pay $85.

August 19, 2004 - After all the criticism, Google went ahead and set their clearing price, i.e., the final IPO price at $85 per share. The company was valued at about $23 billion on its first day.

Global behemoth Transformation of Google:

The $85 per share was just the beginning. Google used the funds from the IPO to dominate
1. Search engine market
2. Develop Android
3. Buy YouTube, and invest in countless other technologies. 

​That initial $85 share has since split multiple times. Just an investment of $1,000 back in 2004 would be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars today. And the rest is history.. 

The key takeaway I had from the Story of Google's unconventional IPO is.. Give returns to your native, support the people who supported you!

  content:`Sept 27, 2025- An unforgivable and unforgettable day of my life. Not talking about the Stampede at Vijay's political rally in Karur... I deeply mourn for the lost souls.. But this day sept 27 is something personal for me.

I'll tell you why... This day shook away the happiness that held my hidden smile from most of you. Drained the last drop of hope that resided in my heart. 

Some days leave scars so deep that you can’t forget them. September 27, 2025, is one of those days for me.

My eyes started to sweat.. Nothing rolled down except thoughts. Those thoughts flowed like a river inside my nerves so that I can't even cope up with it's speed. Some thoughts made me feel guilty, some made me angry, others made me mourn; ultimately, they made me feel lost. But this river of thoughts ended up in a sea - the sea of enlightenment, the sea of happiness, where I found a treasure with a magical scroll containing three spells. 

You know, the bad day of my life ended with a good sleep... That's because those spells that gave me the serenity. 

FIRST SPELL: 

From the day my awareness dawn, I was carrying a trauma silently which was an untold one to my childhood buddies, to my understanding friends, even to my parents. It haunted me for 20 years. But this day sept 27, 2025 dwarfed a bigger trauma than the one I was holding throughout my lifetime.

I was floundering that day... Did I actually do something wrong?
Or am I blaming myself for something beyond my control? These thoughts left me feel guilty ultimately.. But the first spell in the scroll gave me the answer - 

"YOU TRIED IT TRULY, BUT IT WENT BADLY... " -  Yea I tried it truly that's for sure but how it ended? It's not in my hands.. Right?

Fix it; if you can’t, forgive yourself. Grow from it!

Yes... That's the thing I wanted... Because at some point
It's ok to feel guilty... Feeling guilty is just a call from our mind telling us the very thing that we're doing unknowingly was not aligning with our values. 

SECOND SPELL:

I forgave myself but how will I grow from it? 

Over the time, It was my fuel for growing. Now without that essential how my car is gonna run?

I can't compare the pain of my first thought and this... Both are painful... But this thought is not about forgiving it's about forgetting - the very own thing that made me feel happy... This thought gave me the biggest ache.

Surprisingly this thought was stopped when I read the second spell of the scroll... 

Just wanna tell you one thing which I understood from that spell, 
"It doesn't matter how much pain you have endured in past if you get hurt again it pains the same that's for sure. 
Just the threshold goes up.
Keep trusting yourself and start building your own best version."

Yeaa.. The second spell that lifted me up was - "WHAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER EVENTUALLY."

At that moment of sept 27, after reading that second spell, the boy I once was faded, and a man began to emerge. It wasn’t about losing innocence; it was about gaining resilience. It's my official wrap to my teen years. 

Just felt like someone is chanting this in my eyes - Kill the boy, and let the man be born John Snow!

THIRD SPELL:

I didn't remember who said this to me... But in my childhood I heard this from someone "The more you laugh in a day, the more tears you’ll shed by the end of the day."

Of course... It's true

"The Person You Love Is the Person You Fight With."

The house you buy is the house you repair. The dream job you take is the job you stress over.

Everything comes with an inherent sacrifice. Whatever makes us feel good will inevitably also make us feel bad.

In my case.. It's the september month of 2025. It started as a spring but ended in autumn. Coz This is the month I got my placement offer... This month carried my wish come true moments... But by the end it crucified me.

Yet, in rewinding it, I saw myself celebrating the perks and forgot the peak I needed to climb which was awaiting for me... And in my whole life, I too waited for it... 

At some point in life we may feel guilty, angry with ourselves, thought of losing, disappointment, dissatisfaction with our own self, even the feeling of crucification like me.. But think of this, always there will be an INNER DREAM for everyone of us. Start mastering yourself for it. Conquer it. Because I am damn sure when you reach the top of your peak.. That is your desired destiny you will feel satisfied - the guilt, the anger, the pain everything you're carrying vanishes at that moment... It's because you’re the one standing there alone, enduring all your pains and crossing all your own hurdles!

And today I am going to start climbing my peak... What are you going to do? Gonna enjoy your perks or...

Want to know the final spell of the scroll - "NEXT STOP, THE TOP!"

Thanks for reading till the end dear friend.

    content: `The night before last(New year day), I really started to suffocate again. Something stuck in my mind began to haunt me like it did everyday from last November. But it was too bad that day. To be precise, from morning to night it was like a growing graph (i.e., exponential) it just started to go up up and again up. Sorry to explain like this, but unfortunately being an Engineering lad, I only know these stuffs, that’s why graphical representation of sadness came into picture. It affected all my activities, no focus and did nothing that day except eat – just wasted.

But yesterday, I did my workout and, surprisingly, finished a 300 pages book. TBH, a productive day. Crazy, right?

Even yesterday It was inside my mind… yeah the sadness, I had it. I remember, some psychological authors used to say this term – Emotional pain stays within your body. Likewise, my sadness too. But annoyingly, it didn't follow that exponential curve anymore. It was like a flat line.

THE CRAZIEST THING:

What did I do differently? How did I manage? Even though the feeling of sadness remained, it didn't stop my day-to-day activities.

What’s the change? The change was I just deleted one app from my phone. You can probably guess which one. Obviously, it was INSTAGRAM.

How deleting Instagram alone made the day better? Let's see

DIVORCING MY UNDERSTANDING PARTNER (INSTAGRAM):

Recently you must have seen the change in icons of the bottom navigation bar of Instagram.

From: Home-Search-Create-Reels-Profile

To: Home-Reels-Inbox-Search-Profile

It's the most hated update, isn't it? But why they did that? The reason is, They want the very next thing you see after "Home" to be "Reels." They want to maximize your scrolling time. However this design has failed, since we developed the habit of pressing the reels icon from the fourth place in Navigation bar.

Now I think of this, why they wanted you to scroll all time? 

The answer will be “In order to show ads”. Yes, of course.

Let’s make it more interesting, when I was a child while watching TV I used to jump between channels during ads. But if it was my favourite show, I wouldn't miss a single second of it by jumping between channels. Instagram does the same too. You tend to watch the next reel after ad (sometimes ads), because it shows your favourite feed or more relative content. The content relevant to your current life will make you emotionally attached. When you get attached, you will spend more time.

But it doesn’t stop there. Only then, the real villain comes into picture, “EXPLOITATION”.

SOCIALMEDIA EXPLOITATION:

In some cases of married life, one partner may be abused without even realizing that the abuse is happening. Instagram is also exploiting your feelings, without you even “Knowing it”. In my case, I understood my lovely partner (Instagram) was exploiting me. It showed me more relevant feeds and consumed my time, that’s fine. But what strange happened is, I felt stuck, I heard like someone screaming inside my mind telling that – “You didn’t do anything wrong, prove them they’re wrong, Have your revenge by it”. Now all my sadness turned into hatred. Seriously that moment I felt like something evil was sitting on my brain and started to manipulate me.

But even in the darkest of times, there will be light, right? And somewhere inside my mind I heard my own voice, “This is not the real you, Come back”.

On that second, I deleted Instagram, my "beloved wifey". Yeah, that’s the moment I understood how much I was exploited.

It isn't easy to throw away something I've used for 5 years. I will likely install it again, I’ll even share this blog there - BUT THIS TIME, I WILL DECIDE HOW I USE IT. One my friend does this, he will just come to instagram to post stories and after posting he will vanish. It's 100% working guys. It will workout for you too, if you don't have FOMO. Like my mallu friend, I will reinstall it when needed, then delete it again. Like CAPTAIN AMERICA WILL RETURN IN AVENGERS DOOMSDAY and when needed ;)

A SORRY NOTE:

I wrote my last blog on Oct 1 and after that I never touched it. For every writer they feel happy when they write. For me it works differently, I need to feel happy to write. Starting from the end of September for the past three months I never felt happy. I just smiled without happiness. I went through a lot over the last 3 months of 2025, thing that will be hidden inside me forever. A pack of storm after storm moments, something disastrous happened in my life on some random day and I came to know about it after 10 days. That’s how my birthday month went. Isn’t funny? Life is so funny these days.

Everything got fucked up and the however those storms are over now and at least peace is there.

And nowadays I started think that, peace is better than happiness.

Usually I’ll finish writing a blog in one sitting, but for this blog it took four sittings even though it’s not a research needed one. It’s hard for me to write these days and I’ll try to write in future…

Thank you for reading till the end!

  content:`Sometimes, it feels like “Yes, I am in, and I am going to do this!” On the contrary, some things make you feel “Do I really need to do this now?”. That’s exactly how I felt when this topic came to my mind. However, several circumstances pushed me to take a U-turn from “Should I write about this?” to “Yes, I am definitely writing about this!”. 
  
This is a controversial topic, so I should delve directly into the core to make my statement clear. But before the serious stuff makes your brain start braining, let’s look at the circumstances that made me write this blog. Honestly, that’s the only fun part.

  CIRCUMSTANCE 1: The Hostel Debate

  To know this circumstance, you need to travel with me to Boys’ hostel. Huh, Dirty clothes and messy rooms I can hear you. Yeah of course, but “We are good” – we don’t paste any heroine’s poster on the walls, just because we’re not in 90s where they don’t have a phone as well as good internet. We are "good," but I never said we were "so good." I think you know what I mean.

  Let’s see what happened at room E7 on a random day during my first year. This room is where big debates happen. That day, the topic started somewhere and got heated when someone asked: “Should you expect your future wife to be a virgin?”.

  The debate was long and included words I can’t even translate into English. One of my best friends said, “I know I will be a virgin till my marriage, so I expect the same from my wife too”. And I remember how the debate ended “Congrats bro, it’s like finding a dinosaur”.

  People, I am not concluding that all girls are the same. I firmly believe that “A woman’s purity and her family’s pride were never between her legs.” 

  The problem exists on both sides. See in today’s world most of the girls DMs are filled with messages. At least there will be three Romeos. That’s the problem I see on men’s side. The bitter truth is “Boys, women make the path easier for the men they desire”. The whole universe won’t help you, but if she wants you, she will (Hints, man, hints!). 

  But women, “How do you choose that desired guy? The one?”. It’s a two phase process. After I tell that you girls will definitely slay me by saying it’s not like that man and I didn’t just state them from any relationship advice book, personally I heard them from my girly friends. 

  Phase 1 – Efforts matter phase – here you silently observe what he does for you, while pretending you don’t care. 

  Phase 2 – Breaking point – After all the collection of his efforts, at that one last single effort you will start to feel “He will do anything for me”. The problem I see in women’s side is this two phase attraction process. 

  Dear ladies, A man’s priorities change over time. Some point in life he should only be focusing on his career because after the age of 20 it’s the man’s responsibility to take his family on his shoulders, the entire upcoming generation depends on him. But for women it’s not like that MOST OFTEN, they have options and I say this according to India. I am not stating that men are the pillars of responsibility, even my mother is a working woman she supported my family all the time, really wanted to underline that most often in the last sentence. Coming to that point of man’s focusing period, if you feel your man is ignoring you then you’re not in an understanding relationship. Yeah, that’s the truth the efforts he had put for you are the good moments and his struggles are his bad moments. If you can’t understand his struggles, How can you guys be a strong couple in future?”.

  CIRCUMSTANCE 2: Bad girl

  Recently, I watched the movie Bad Girl. The thoughts were appealing and it was a coming of age film. I personally loved the movie and I wanted to see how a woman reviewed it. So I asked for my female friend’s Letterboxd ID who had seen that movie. But the twist was I never saw bad girl review. Surprisingly what I saw was the review for the movie named Aan paavam polladhadhu. It’s her wish to review whatever she felt but the review started with, The director is a male chauvinist. There were flaws in the film too, I totally agree. As a movie watcher, book reader or whatever, we should take only the good from it not the bad or disturbing ones. It was just the author’s POV.

  That film made me realize two things:

  1.	The whole society isn't like what you see on screen; it’s just one director's perspective.

  2.	However, couples like those in the movies do exist.

  Personally, I loved that film. Now will she call me a male chauvinist? Definitely not! She knows all my struggles and problems I faced till date.

  These are those circumstances.

  Dear friends, you all have watched CHAK DE! INDIA. To me it’s the best sports movie ever filmed by Indian cinema and it’s one of the rarest gem that speaks real “Feminism”. In one scene, SRK takes all the players of the Indian women’s hockey team to a restaurant for his farewell. In the restaurant a guy harasses one of the players, SRK as a hero of the film never shows heroism by entering the scene, he silently sits back and makes all the women unite to defeat him. Because in that particular scene SRK knows the united power of his girls can defeat that guy. That’s what I am trying to convey 
  
“THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY A MAN AND EVERYTHING CAN BE DONE BY TODAY’S WOMAN FROM BEING PILOT TO PRESIDENT”.

  WOMEN ARE EVERYWHERE, THEY ARE IN EVERY SECTOR – SO THERE IS NO NEED FOR A MAN TO LIFT YOU UP.

  Hardly 2 decades of the film, bad shit was I still see guys acting as coach and motivating a girl behind the door to come out and play. Kinda heroism our generation enjoy watching.

  RANDOM THOUGHT:

  In the olden days, women were confined to kitchen - just cooking.

  But now, Modern men are really different. They say you’re free dear, independent. You just - Go work, let’s help each other to run the family. But what about cooking? Well they say – you can do that too dear. Understood the loop, see how intelligent we men are, making you earn and help the family as well as to cook. I think this trend is changing these days as most men are accompanying their woman not only in the bedroom but also in the kitchen.

  If confining a woman to a kitchen was an act of slavery, then forcing her to work, handle the kids, and cook – all at once - in a woman’s head, isn’t that slavery?

  May be you can show me the education rate, success rate of women over the decades. I agree with that but it’s completely a woman’s decision to WORK OR COOK | WORK AS WELL AS COOK.

  TO ALL MY FELLOWS,

  Like I said “Women are everywhere, they can empower themselves and THEY WILL EMPOWER THEMSELVES”.

  Empowerment isn't a gift men "give" to women.

  So,

  We-men don’t need to make Women Independent

  We-men don’t need to empower Women… :)

Thanks man for reading till the end!
